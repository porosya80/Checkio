# "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.
#
# You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
# "Fizz Buzz"if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
# "Fizz"if the number is divisible by 3;
# "Buzz"if the number is divisible by 5;
# The numberas a string for other cases.
#
#
# Input:A number as an integer.
#
# Output:The answer as a string.
#
# Precondition:0 < number â‰¤ 1000
#
#
# END_DESC

# Your optional code here
# You can import some modules or create additional functions

    elif number % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    else:
        return str(number)

# Some hints:
# Convert a number in the string with str(n)


# These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
